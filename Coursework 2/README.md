This repository contains the files for coursework 2 of the course **F29AI**.

This project is about creating the game Tic Tac Toe using the concepts of Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Q Learning.

All except 3 files were given by the course instructor. Only those 3 files were to be edited. The 3 files are *ValueIterationAgent.java* , *PolicyIterationAgent.java* and
*QLearningAgent.java*.

When the file is run, a grid with their location numbers is shown to the user. The user has to choose a location and enter the number to play their move. More information on how
to play the game is given in the *coursework description file.*

The algorithm to calculate the transition values are given in the lectures, we simply had to use those formulas.

The files when run allow the user to play the game against the computer.
There are test files given to check whether the algorithm works for each concept. Each concept is tested against 3 agents for 50 iterations : *Aggressive*, *Defensive* and *Random*.
The outputs for each concept if given in the form of a report.
