**F29AI coursework 1**

This repository contains the code for coursework 1 of the course **F29AI**.

This project focuses on 3 languages namely *Java*, *Prolog* and *PDDL*.

The **Java** part of the coursework focuses on **A*star Search***. We were asked to implement a solution to the grid problems given. Two grids are given, where the agent tries to
find a path from the **start(S)** to the **goal(G)**. The cost and rules of moving the agent to each sqaure is given in the coursework description file. We use the 
**Manhattan distance heuristic** to get the heuristic values. Starter code has been provided by the course instructor. The output is also included in a *.txt* file.
The grids are given in the coursework description file. 

The **Prolog** part of the coursework focuses on ***Knowledge Representation***.
A popular fictional monster battling game features a type system that is used to determine the effectiveness of a monsterâ€™s ability to attack or defend against another monster.
A Prolog program to represent knowledge about this system and to answer queries is written. Specifications about the prolog facts and rules are given. An output file with queries is made.
The knowledge base about the monsters and their moves are given in the coursework description file.

The **PDDL** part of the coursework focuses on ***Automated Planning***.
A scenario and instances are given in the coursework description file. Using this, we are asked to create a domain file and problem files.
